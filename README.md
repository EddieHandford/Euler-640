# Euler-640
Brute Force Approach to Euler Problem 640

https://projecteuler.net/
Problem number 640

"640 game" is the code for the full question.

2019 UPDATE! - see https://github.com/EddieHandford/Euler-640-v2

Solved! 
In order to reduce the processing time, the rolling mechanism was improved (approx x3 faster) and other improvements,
These source files are not availble for public use due to the restrictions in place on the Euler.net 


2018:
Note : this code does not give the answer in a timely manner, the approx solving time on a standard desktop is 1-2 years.
A brute force approach was coded, in order to improve a memory function is likely to be required in order to ensure the 
same path is not taken mulitple times, furthermore , routes which have a probability low enough to not efect the total result 
(to 6 decimal places) should be avoided
Any help or suggestions on the memory based implementation would be greatly appreciated
Note : to get an answer reduce the play value to 10000 ish: 
line 62: 
while ( play<10000000) :
