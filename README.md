Problem number 640

file " 640 shit game" is the example game in the question 
"640 game" is the code for the full question.


Note : this code does not give the answer in a timely manner, the approx solving time on a standard desktop is 1-2 years.
A brute force approach was coded, in order to improve a memory function is likely to be required in order to ensure the 
same path is not taken mulitple times, furthermore , routes which have a probability low enough to not efect the total result 
(to 6 decimal places) should be avoided


Any help or suggestions on the memory based implementation would be greatly appreciated





Note : to get an answer reduce the play value to 10000 ish: 

line 62: 
while ( play<10000000) :
